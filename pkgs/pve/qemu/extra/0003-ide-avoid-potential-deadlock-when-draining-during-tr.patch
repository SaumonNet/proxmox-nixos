Subject: [PATCH] ide: avoid potential deadlock when draining during trim
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The deadlock can happen as follows:
1. ide_issue_trim is called, and increments the in_flight counter.
2. ide_issue_trim_cb calls blk_aio_pdiscard.
3. Somebody else starts draining (e.g. backup to insert the cbw node).
4. ide_issue_trim_cb is called as the completion callback for
   blk_aio_pdiscard.
5. ide_issue_trim_cb issues yet another blk_aio_pdiscard request.
6. The request is added to the wait queue via blk_wait_while_drained,
   because draining has been started.
7. Nobody ever decrements the in_flight counter and draining can't
   finish. This would be done by ide_trim_bh_cb, which is called after
   ide_issue_trim_cb has issued its last request, but
   ide_issue_trim_cb is not called anymore, because it's the
   completion callback of blk_aio_pdiscard, which waits on draining.

Quoting Hanna Czenczek:

> ide_issue_trim_cb() returns in two cases (and, recursively through
> its callers, leaves s->bus->dma->aiocb set):
> 1. After calling blk_aio_pdiscard(), which will keep an in-flight
>    count,
> 2. After calling replay_bh_schedule_event() (i.e.
>    qemu_bh_schedule()), which does not keep an in-flight count.

Thus, even after moving the blk_inc_in_flight to above the
replay_bh_schedule_event call, the invariant "ide_issue_trim_cb
returns with an accompanying in-flight count" is still satisfied.

However, the issue 7e5cdb345f fixed for canceling resurfaces, because
ide_cancel_dma_sync assumes that it just needs to drain once. But now
the in_flight count is not consistently > 0 during the trim operation.
So, change it to drain until !s->bus->dma->aiocb, which means that the
operation finished (s->bus->dma->aiocb is cleared by ide_set_inactive
via the ide_dma_cb when the end of the transfer is reached).
